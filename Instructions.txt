Install Django.
Install mySQL client for Django.
You can find how to install Django here : https://github.com/Yunus0or1/Guidelines-How_TO/blob/master/How%20to%20use%20Django%20Framework.txt
This project need Python 3.6.2 as this is the last version [upto this text file creation] that supports mysqlclient.
Install Xampp.
Clone or download the project.
Load nlp.sql in Database.
Open the cmd.
Set the path to the project.
Run the project in localhost.


You may need to pip these commands in terminal :

pip install Django
pip install nltk
pip install googletrans
pip install "mysqlclient==1.3.2"

Update :

When this project was being uploaded googletrans stopped working. So I would suggest everyone to check if googletrans working in that time.
You have to check stackoverflow or Github discussion to fix this. You can use first 2 features like finding compound word and finding total
number of bangla word easily. But you can not use those features which use googletrans to translate Bangla meaning to English.
